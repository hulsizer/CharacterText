/*

Checks the status of one or more asynchronous photo upload tickets.

<p>There is one <code>&lt;ticket&gt;</code> element for each ticket id supplied. The <code>id</code> attribute contains the corresponding ticket id. If the ticket wasn't found, the <code>invalid</code> attribute is set. The status of the ticket is passed in the <code>status</code> attribute; 0 means not completed, 1 means completed and 2 means the ticket failed (indicating there was a problem converting the file). When the status is 1, the photo id is passed in the <code>photoid</code> attribute. The photo id can then be used as with the <a href="/services/api/upload.api.html">synchronous upload API</a>.

Response:

<uploader>
	<ticket id="128" complete="1" photoid="2995" />
	<ticket id="129" complete="0" />
	<ticket id="130" complete="2" />
	<ticket id="131" invalid="1" />
</uploader>
