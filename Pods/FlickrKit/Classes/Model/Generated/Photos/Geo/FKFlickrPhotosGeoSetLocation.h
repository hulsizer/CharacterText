Sets the geo data (latitude and longitude and, optionally, the accuracy level) for a photo.

Before users may assign location data to a photo they must define who, by default, may view that information. Users can edit this preference at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/account/geo/privacy/">http://www.flickr.com/account/geo/privacy/</a>. If a user has not set this preference, the API method will return an error.
